<p>TUDublin harnesses a part of its energy through a geothermal plant that is 1km deep. 

    An engineer monitors this plant and notices fluctuations in energy and one day the whole campus goes off and students canâ€™t learn, and all the alarms go off. 
    
    Security checks the camera and notices something strange (alien video) 
    
    With the alarms blaring everybody evacuates and the building is empty and deaf 
    
    Because everyone is out the aliens are trying to control the campus 
    
    The engineer needs your help to catch these aliens to save the planet and become the hero 
    
    (The alien currency may be a prize that can be used for the stalls)  </p>
